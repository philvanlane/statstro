    sam_berek: 'Sam is a 5th year PhD candidate in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics supervised by Gwen Eadie and Josh Speagle, and a Data Sciences Institute Doctoral Student Fellow. Her research uses globular cluster populations of dwarf galaxies to probe early, large scale star formation in the universe. She develops novel statistical methodologies for small-sample statistics and zero-inflated models for her work.',

    phil_vanlane: 'Phil is a 3rd year PhD candidate in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics co-supervised by Drs. Eadie and Speagle and Dr. Ryan Cloutier (McMaster). His research focuses on the application of statistics and machine learning to the study of low mass stars and their surrounding planets.',
    mairead_heiger: 'Mairead is a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, supervised by Ting Li and Josh Speagle. She studies galactic chemical evolution using metal-poor stars and dwarf galaxies. Specifically, her research focuses on constraining nucleosynthetic yields with hierarchical modelling techniques. She is also interested in science communication and methods in stellar spectroscopy.'
