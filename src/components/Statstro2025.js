          We are thrilled to announce the <b>STATSTRO 2025 WORKSHOP</b> (formerly Stellar Stats), co-hosted between the Department of Statistical Sciences, the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics, and the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics. Our theme for this year will be <b><i>Wrangling Data: Big and Small.</i></b>
          This 1-day workshop is intended to foster new and existing interdisciplinary collaborations between astronomy and statistics!
          There will be FREE LUNCH and no registration fee. This will be a hybrid meeting with both in-person and online participation options.
          Anyone interested is encouraged to attend (including summer students)! Please register using the link on this site
          by <b><i>11:59 pm on Wednesday, April 30th</i></b> so we know how much food to order. (You are still welcome to attend even if you donâ€™t end up registering by the deadline!)
          Early career researchers (undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers) who are interested in attending are also highly encouraged to sign up to give a 5-minute lightning talk highlighting their work.
